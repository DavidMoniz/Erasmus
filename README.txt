This is a full stack project, using LARAVEL framework. 

The goal of the project is to digitalize the process of applying for Erasmus+ since the traditional process 
takes a long time to registrations, multiple signatures and stampings and approval of both universities.

There's five types of users, the normal viewer, the student, the manager(the Erasmus coordinator of the student's home university), 
the director(the student's course/degree's coordinator) and the admin.
This means that a student can apply online and scan their signed papers, therefore, the director will receive 
the students document, print, sign and scan the document and finally the manager will print, sign, stamp and upload the document, 
ready to approve or not and send to the host university.

This project was great since it combined our individual subjects all into one project.
We used Laravel framework PHP, HTML, JS(JS,JQUERY and AJAX), CSS(not in SASS), MySql(XAMP), Node.js and SOCKET I/O.
We took advantage of laravel framework's so we used MVC, REST(CRUD through routing), server-side scripting and layout structure. 

Any question please contact me.
